In 2018, there were several indications of economic downturns:

Global Growth: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised global growth downward to 3.7% for 2018, reflecting rising risks from trade wars and tighter global financing conditions.
Advanced Economies: Growth in advanced economies was weak, with specific challenges in the Eurozone due to fiscal issues in Italy and uncertainties related to Brexit.
Emerging Markets: These economies faced adverse effects from the rapid appreciation of the US dollar, raising concerns about debt sustainability.
Trade Tensions: Escalating trade tensions posed significant downside risks to the global outlook, potentially affecting about 5% of global trade flows.
Eurozone: The Eurozone's economy lost momentum due to dampened external demand and political uncertainty, with the Composite PMI dropping to its lowest level in over two years.
China: China's GDP growth slowed to 6.4% year-on-year, the lowest since the global financial crisis, amid trade disputes with the US and weakening domestic demand.
These factors contributed to a cautious economic outlook for 2018.

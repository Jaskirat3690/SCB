In 2018, the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio in Saudi Arabia's banking sector increased to 2.0% from 1.6% in 2017. This rise in defaults can likely be attributed to several factors, including:

1. Economic Adjustments: The Saudi economy was undergoing significant adjustments due to the implementation of structural reforms and policy changes aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil dependence. These changes can disrupt businesses, leading to increased defaults.

2. Higher Spending and Inflationary Pressures: The overall economic environment included rising government spending and inflationary pressures, which could have strained borrowers' cash flows and their ability to service debts, thus contributing to a higher NPL ratio , .

3. Transition Challenges: The effects of the exit of expatriate workers and dependents due to various economic reforms may have also impacted consumer demand and business operations, further exacerbating financial stress for some borrowers .

4. Impact of VAT Introduction: The introduction of the VAT in January 2018, coupled with rising prices for utilities and other goods, could have created financial pressure on consumers and businesses, leading to increased defaults as individuals and companies adjusted to higher costs in a restructured economic landscape .

Overall, these factors combined likely contributed to the increase in defaults observed in 2018 compared to the previous year.
